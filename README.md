# AutoTrader-Scraper
This tool will scrape Autotrader using multiple threads. It will keep track of a car's name, year, mileage and asking price and will create a CSV file for the data. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A computer with python and pip installed. 

### How to Run

Open the terminal in the cloned folder. 
```
. install.sh
python index.py
```
The first command will install the dependencies required for the script to run and the second will create a csv file called, "Possibles.csv".
